<p>I am proud to announce the release of version 1.3 of the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:REST_API">Bugzilla REST API</a>. This maintenance release has a bug fix or two, and fully supports the version of Bugzilla 4.2 which has just been deployed on bugzilla.mozilla.org. For smooth interaction with BMO, you should be using this version.</p>
<p>The installation of BzAPI <b>1.1</b> on api-dev.bugzilla.mozilla.org <b>will go away in 4 weeks, on 4th April</b>. There is a limit to the number of old versions we can support on the server, particularly as the older ones can put a larger load on Bugzilla and may not work correctly. Please use either the /1.3 or the /latest endpoints. Now that BzAPI has been stable for some time, tools which earlier rejected using the /latest endpoint may want to reconsider.</p>
