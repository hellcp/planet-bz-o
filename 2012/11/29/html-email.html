<p>Guest tip from Stefan Arentz:</p>
<p>“Bugzilla actually does have HTML emails! <i>[As of version 4.2, but it’s been backported to bugzilla.mozilla.org’s 4.0 installation – Ed.]</i> I always though that it did not because I did not look further than the “Email Preferences” tab. But there actually is a “Preferred email format” under the “General Preferences” tab.</p>
<p>This makes Bugzilla emails 100x easier to read on a phone.”</p>
