<p>I am proud to announce the release of version 1.2 of the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:REST_API">Bugzilla REST API</a>. This maintenance release has a bug fix or two, and some features useful to the admins of Bugzillas which BzAPI is pointed at.</p>
<p>The installation of BzAPI <b>1.0</b> on api-dev.bugzilla.mozilla.org <b>will go away in 4 weeks, on 19th December</b>. There is a limit to the number of old versions we can support on the server, particularly as the older ones can put a larger load on Bugzilla. Please use either the /1.2 or the /latest endpoints. Now that BzAPI has been stable for some time, tools which earlier rejected using the /latest endpoint may want to reconsider.</p>
