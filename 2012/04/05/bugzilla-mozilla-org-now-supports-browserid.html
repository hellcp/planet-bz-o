<p>You can now log in to <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/">bugzilla.mozilla.org</a> using <a href="http://browserid.org/">BrowserID</a>, courtesy of a <a href="http://bzr.mozilla.org/bugzilla/extensions/browserid/trunk/files">Bugzilla extension I wrote</a>. Log out and then click the “Login” link in the header and then the orange “Sign in” button to try it.</p>
<p>You can do this – unless, that is, you are a member of certain particularly sensitive groups. While Mozilla has great confidence in the BrowserID technology, it does not have perfect confidence in my coding ;-) Therefore, we are restricting who can log in until we get a little more experience with my extension. Eventually, it’s possible that we might go the other way and <i>require</i> BrowserID for certain sensitive groups, once BrowserID primaries appear with 2-factor authentication. But that’s a little way off yet.</p>
<p>If you visit your <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/userprefs.cgi?tab=permissions">permissions page</a>, you can see if you should be able to log in using BrowserID. If you are listed as a member of the “no-browser-id” group, you shouldn’t. Otherwise, you should. The no-browser-id group is currently made up of members of the following groups: admin, bz_sudoers, autoland, generic-assignees, hr, infrasec, legal, and anything with “security” in its name.</p>
