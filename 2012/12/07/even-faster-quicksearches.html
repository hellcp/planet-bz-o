<p>To speed up quicksearches, limit the search by product or component. Add “comp: &lt;string&gt;” to your query to limit it to components whose names contain that string. As an abbreviation, you can simply use “:” instead of “comp:”, although that also searches in products whose names which contain the string. </p>
<p>By analogy with the use of “:”, there are <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/page.cgi?id=quicksearch.html#shortcuts">abbreviations for some other common fields</a> as well.</p>
