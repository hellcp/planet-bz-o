Or, how to migrate to git using only three programming languages Another aspect of Bugzilla has been dragged, kicking &amp; screaming, into the future! On March 11, 2014, the Bugzilla source moved to git.mozilla.org. Weâ€™re still mirroring to bzr.mozilla.org (more on that later), but the repository of record is now git, meaning it is the only place we accept new code.
Getting over there was no small feat, so I want to record the adventure in the hopes that it can benefit someone else, and so I can look back some day and wonder why I put myself through these things.
