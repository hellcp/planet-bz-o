<p>Vanilla Bugzilla lets you decide which bugmail you receive based on what changed about a bug. But there are a couple of extensions which give you even more control, and both are installed on <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/">bugzilla.mozilla.org</a>. So the new email filtering pipeline is as follows:</p>
<p>Firstly, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/userprefs.cgi?tab=component_watch">ComponentWatching</a>, as the name implies, lets you “watch” particular products or components, so you get put on the list to receive bugmail for all changes to any bugs in those products or components. This is very useful if you have an interest in a particular area of the project. You can also watch particular users – that function is built-in.</p>
<p>Secondly, the <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/userprefs.cgi?tab=email">normal email filters</a> run, which exclude or include you from emails based on the particular fields which have been changed in the bug update.</p>
<p>Lastly, the <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/userprefs.cgi?tab=bugmail_filter">BugmailFilter</a> extension allows you to define “include” or “exclude” rules based on any one of:</p>
<ul>
<li>the field changed</li>
<li>the current product</li>
<li>the current component</li>
<li>your relationship to the bug</li>
<li>who made the change (useful to exclude changes made by bots).</li>
</ul>
<p>Using these three capabilities in tandem, it should be possible to carefully control how much bugmail you receive, even if you are using a system like Gmail which does not have good client-side filtering.</p>
