<p>In 2010, <a href="http://blog.johnath.com/">johnath</a> did a very popular video introducing people to Bugzilla, called “<a href="http://blog.johnath.com/2010/02/04/bugzilla-for-humans/">Bugzilla for Humans</a>“. While age has been kind to johnath, it has been less kind to his video, which now contains several screenshots and bits of dialogue which are out of date. And, being a video featuring a single presenter, it is somewhat difficult to “patch” it.</p>
<p>Enter Popcorn Maker, the Mozilla Foundation’s multimedia presentation creation tool. I have written a script for a replacement presentation, voiced it up, and used Popcorn Maker to put it together. It’s branded as being in the “Understanding Mozilla” series, as a sequel to “<a href="http://blog.gerv.net/2013/03/um-communications-v0-1/">Understanding Mozilla: Communications</a>” which I made last year.</p>
<p>So, I present “<a href="https://gerv.makes.org/popcorn/1bn6">Understanding Mozilla: Bugzilla</a>“, an 8.5 minute introduction to Bugzilla as we use it here in the Mozilla project:</p>

<p>Because it’s a Popcorn presentation, it can be remixed. So if the instructions ever change, or Bugzilla looks different, new screenshots can be patched in or erroneous sections removed. It’s not trivial to seamlessly patch my voiceover unless you get me to do it, but it’s still much more possible than patching a video. (In fact, the current version contains a voice patch.) It can also be localized – the script is <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Capture_Mozilla/Bugzilla">available</a>, and someone could translate it into another language, voice it up, and then remix the presentation and adjust the transitions accordingly.</p>
<p>Props go to the Popcorn team for making such a great tool, and the Developer Tools team for Responsive Design View and the Screenshot button, which makes it trivial to reel off a series of screenshots of a website in a particular custom size/shape format without any need for editing.</p>
