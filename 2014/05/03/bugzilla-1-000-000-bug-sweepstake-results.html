<p>Milestone bugzilla.mozilla.org bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1000000">1,000,000</a> was filed on 2014-04-23 at 01:10 ZST by Archaeopteryx (although rumour has it he used a script, as he also filed the 12 previous bugs in quick succession). The title of the bug was initially “Long word suggestions can move/shift keyboard partially off screen so it overflows” (a Firefox OS Gaia::Keyboard bug, now <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1000025">bug 1000025</a>), but has since been changed to “Celebrate 1000000 bugs, bring your own drinks.”</p>
<p>The winner of the <a href="http://blog.gerv.net/2013/08/bugzilla-1000000-bug-sweepstake/">sweepstake</a> to guess the date and time is <a href="https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/Gijs/">Gijs Kruitbosch</a>, who guessed 2014-04-25 05:43:21 – which is 2 days, 4 hours, 33 minutes and 5 seconds out. This is a rather wider error, measured in seconds, than the previous sweepstake, but this one had a much longer time horizon – it was instituted <a href="http://blog.gerv.net/2013/08/bugzilla-1000000-bug-sweepstake/">9 months ago</a>. So that’s an error of about 0.95%. The 800,000 bug winner had an error of about 1.55% using the same calculation, so in those terms Gijs’ effort is actually better. </p>

I’m Dutch, recently moved to Britain, and I’ll be celebrating my 10th “mozversary” sometime later this year (for those who are counting, bugs had 6 digits and started with “2” when I got going). Back in 2004, I got started by working on ChatZilla, later the Venkman JS debugger and a bit of Firefox, and last year I started working on Firefox as my day job. Outside of Mozilla, I play the piano every now and then, and try to adjust to living in a nation that <a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/pete.meg/wcc/facility-of-the-month/November2004.htm">puts phone booths in its cycle paths</a>.

<p>The two runners-up are <a href="https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/hmork/">Håvard Mork</a> (2d 14h 50m 52s out) and <a href="https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/Standard8/">Mark Banner</a> (8d 8h 24m 36s out). Håvard writes:</p>

My name is Håvard Mork. I’m a Java software developer, working with Firefox and web localization to Norwegian. I’ve been involved with localization since 2003. I think localization is rewarding, because it is a process of understanding the mindset of the users, and their perception of IT.</p>
<p>I’m surprised that my estimate came that close. I spent almost an hour trying to figure out how much bug numbers grow, and estimate the exponential components. Unfortunately I lost the equation, so need to start over for the 2,000,000 sweepstakes…

I’m Mark Banner, also known as Standard8 on irc, I work from home in the UK. I came to Mozilla through volunteering on Thunderbird, and then working at Mozilla Messaging. I still manage Thunderbird releases. Alongside those, I am working on the Loop project (formally Talkilla), which is aiming to provide a real time communications service for Mozilla products, built on top of WebRTC.

<p>Gijs will get a Most Splendid Package, and also a <a href="https://twitter.com/sheeri/status/458654954824024064">knitted thing from Sheeri</a> as a special bonus prize! The other winners will receive something a little less splendid, but I’m sure it’ll be worth having nevertheless.</p>
