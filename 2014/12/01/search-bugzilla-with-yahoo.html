<p>The Bugzilla team is aware that there are currently 5 different methods of searching Bugzilla (as explained in <a href="http://blog.gerv.net/2014/11/bugzilla-for-humans-ii/">yesterday’s presentation</a>) – Instant Search, Simple Search, Advanced Search, Google Search and QuickSearch. It has been argued that this is too many, and that we should simplify the options available – perhaps building a search which is all three of Instant, Simple and Quick, instead of just one of them. Some Bugzilla developers have sympathy with that view. </p>
<p>I, however, having caught the mood of the times, feel that Mozilla is all about choice, and there is still not enough choice in Bugzilla search. Therefore, I have decided to add a sixth option for those who want it. As of today, December 1st, by installing this <a href="http://www.gerv.net/software/userscripts/Bugzilla_Yahoo!_Search.user.js">GreaseMonkey script</a>, you can now search Bugzilla with Yahoo! Search. (To do this, obviously, you will need a copy of <a href="http://www.greasespot.net/">GreaseMonkey</a>.) It looks like this:</p>

<p>In the future, I may create a Bugzilla extension which allows users to fill the <a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Fourth_plinth,_Trafalgar_Square">fourth tab</a> on the search page with the search engine of their choice, perhaps leveraging the <a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/OpenSearch">OpenSearch</a> standard. Then, you will be able to search Bugzilla using the search engine which provides the best experience in your locale.</p>
<p>Viva choice!</p>
