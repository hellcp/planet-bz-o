It’s been a whole year since my last BMO update, partly because I’ve been busy with MozReview (and blogging a lot about it), and partly because the BMO team got distracted from our goals by a few sudden priority changes, which I’ll get to later in this post.
Plans from 2014 Even with some large interruptions, we fully achieved three of our five goals for the year and made good progress on a fourth.
