<p>The recent release of Bugzilla 5.0 was the first release sporting the <a href="http://bugzilla.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">new, improved Bugzilla documentation</a>, which has been moved from DocBook XML to reStructuredText to make it easier to edit and so more likely to be up-to-date :-).</p>
<p>Readers of this blog may be particularly interested in the <a href="http://bugzilla.readthedocs.org/en/latest/using/index.html">User Guide</a>. Feedback on the new docs is welcome, particularly suggestions for where it is lacking â€“ please use the bug filing link at the bottom of each docs page.</p>
